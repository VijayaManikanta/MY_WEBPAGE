							The need for more effective information security practices is increasingly evident with each security breach reported in the media.

When adopting new technologies like cloud computing, virtualization, or IT outsourcing, enterprises are facing imminent security threats and must adjust their security processes, policies, and architectures accordingly.

Among the many options available to help customers to achieve this goal, organizations should consider the value of ethical hacking services, which are rapidly gaining attention as an essential security practice that should be performed on a regular basis.

The recently published white paper entitled “The Importance of Ethical Hacking: Emerging Threats Emphasise the Need for Holistic Assessments” by Frost & Sullivan, discusses benefits from independent ethical hacking assessments.

This assessment is a first vital step to enact effective security policies, procedures, and infrastructure that will prevent or mitigate the effects of a data breach.
							The major challenge for businesses is the complexity of security requirements due to changing hacking tactics, myriad security vulnerabilities, evolving business practices, new business technologies, and emerging security technologies. Those numerous organization-specific security challenges are best solved by professionals with extensive expertise.
							Ethical hacking offers an objective analysis of an organization’s information security posture for organizations of any level of security expertise....... <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2012/04/20/the-importance-of-ethical-hacking/"> continue reading</a>
